    Project Strategic Plan: Goal Tracker Calendar

    This document outlines the phased implementation of the Goal Tracker WebApp.

    Phase 1: Foundation & UI Architecture (Week 1)

    Milestone 1.1: Project Setup

    Initialize repository.

    Setup Tailwind CSS configuration.

    Define the color palette based on the UI reference.

    Milestone 1.2: Static Layout Construction

    Implement the dual-panel layout (Side Panel + Main Content).

    Create the toggle logic for Side Panel position (Left vs. Right).

    Design the mobile view (Side Panel behavior for small screens).

    Milestone 1.3: Calendar Component (UI Only)

    Build a reusable CSS Grid calendar for a single month.

    Implement the "Month/Year" static header.

    Phase 2: Supabase Integration & Auth (Week 2)

    Milestone 2.1: Supabase Project Setup

    Create Supabase project and define tables (profiles, goals, completions, notes).

    Milestone 2.2: Google Authentication

    Integrate Supabase Auth with Google Provider.

    Implement the Login/Logout flow.

    Milestone 2.3: Data Modeling

    Ensure RLS (Row Level Security) is set so users only see their own goals.

    Phase 3: Goal Management (Week 3)

    Milestone 3.1: Goal Creation

    Build the UI to add a new goal (Title, Description, Color).

    Enforce the 10-goal limit logic.

    Milestone 3.2: Multi-Calendar Rendering

    Dynamically render up to 10 calendars in the main section based on database entries.

    Milestone 3.3: Interactive Marking

    Implement "Click to mark" logic: clicking a day toggles the goal status and updates the database.

    Phase 4: Side Panel Intelligence (Week 4)

    Milestone 4.1: Goal Detail View

    Sync the top of the side panel with the "focused" goal.

    Implement the "Click goal list -> Focus calendar" navigation logic.

    Milestone 4.2: Notes System

    Build the scrollable notes section.

    Add "Note-Date" linking: Highlighting a note highlights the corresponding date on the calendar.

    Phase 5: Navigation & History (Week 5)

    Milestone 5.1: Month/Year Switcher

    Implement the logic to fetch and display data for previous months/years.

    Milestone 5.2: Smooth Scrolling & Focus

    Refine the "Focus on calendar" animation for better UX.

    Phase 6: Refinement & Mobile (Week 6)

    Milestone 6.1: UX/UI Polish

    Add transitions and hover effects.

    Finalize mobile responsiveness.

    Milestone 6.2: Offline Preparations (PWA)

    Initial setup of Manifest and Service Workers for future local installation.

    Phase 7: Future Expansion (Roadmap)

    Milestone 7.1: Statistics Dashboard

    Visualizing success rates and streaks.

    Milestone 7.2: Notifications

    Setup push notifications for daily check-ins.

    Milestone 7.3: Local Storage / Offline Sync

    Optimize for slow connections using Supabase cache/persistence.

    Current Status: [Phase 1.1 - Initializing Project]
