The view on the left is an exterior rendering, showcasing the building's overall form, which features a prominent green, arched roof. The view on the right is an exploded isometric diagram that deconstructs the building to reveal its internal arrangement. This view clearly illustrates the relationship between the different floor plates, the structural frame, and the overarching roof canopy. It effectively communicates the project's spatial organization and key design elements in a three-dimensional context.</p>

            <p>This is a longitudinal section drawing of the building. It cuts through the length of the structure, revealing the interior spaces and the vertical relationships between the different levels. The drawing highlights a change in grade, with the front section of the building set at a lower elevation. It also provides detail on the floor-to-ceiling heights, the positioning of stairs, and the use of large openings to bring in light. The section is a crucial tool for understanding the building's internal volume and the progression of spaces.</p>

            <p>This image presents the site plan, titled "Plano de sitio." It shows the building's footprint and its orientation within the larger plot. The plan indicates that the building is a long, rectangular structure flanked by two large, green-colored areas. This suggests a design that integrates the building with its surrounding landscape, likely providing outdoor or landscaped spaces on either side of the main volume.</p>

            <p>This is the floor plan for the first level, labeled "1 Nivel." The plan shows a layout divided into two main parts. The right side features a series of defined rooms and spaces, including what appear to be multiple offices or smaller rooms, with a central circulation area. The left side is a large, open, and undefined space, suggesting a flexible or multi-purpose area such as a lobby, an open hall, or an exhibition space. This contrast highlights the dual-purpose nature of the building's ground floor.</p>
