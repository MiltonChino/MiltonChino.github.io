        My name is Milton Chino. I am working to complete my Software
        Development Bachelor's Degree. I am to practice some html and css this
        semester. In the past I have been working for this objective, but I was
        also trying to do other things at the same time. Now, I am focused and
        plan to finish as soon as possible. Hope this time of practice will help
        me improce my skills at writing pure code.

        I enjoy watching movies and some series. In my free time, I like to
        read, well I am try to build a better reading habit. I like to spend
        time with my family, we were recently blessed with a little baby, and
        together with my wife we are delighted in the first months of life of
        our child. He is in the time when he smiles almost at everyone and
        brings a smile to your face, no matter how you feel.
